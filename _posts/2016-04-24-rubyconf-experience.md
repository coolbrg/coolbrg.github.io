This year of [**RubyConf India**](http://rubyconfindia.org 'Awesome Conf') was
held at God's own country, Kerala on 19-20 March 2016. It was indeed the special
event as both Ruby and JRuby designers were present in this conference.

It started with getting the Rubyconf ticket a month ago in "resale". I was lucky
to get resale "Early bird ticket" worth Rs 6500. Then, booked train ticket after
getting the conference ticket.

On 18th March, I left Bangalore at around 5 PM and reached
Ernakulam Junction(nearest railway station from Venue) at 4:30 AM in the morning.
Luckily, I had [RAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_against_Cancellation)
ticket but managed to get confirmed ticket and slept well :smile:.
I checked in around 5 AM in [Le Meridien Hotel Kochi](http://www.lemeridienkochi.com) and
had couple of hours sleep before heading to conference.

1st day of conference started with helping out in "Registration Desk" with grouping and
distributing the T-shirts to attendees. Don't know "Why?" but like helping during
**registration process** :neutral_face:.

The Ruby Conference started with keynote by
[Matz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto) (chief designer of the Ruby
programming language) showing glimpse of what is coming in **Ruby 3 - Improved Performance
 and Concurrency**. Then, other talks started which you could find all at once in
my previous blog, [Rubyconf India 2016 Slides]({{ site.url }}/writing/2016/03/22/rubyconf-india-2016-slides/).

Meanwhile, attending the talks before lunch, I was working on my "lightning talk"
presentation which I could able to finish well before lunch. I was determined and very excited to
give my **first** lightning talk :wink:. As the time crawling for lightning talk session,
I was getting bit nervous :fearful:. I sipped few ml of water before my turn.
Need of adjusting AV settings for presentation increased the nervousness bit more.
Thanks to [Gautam](https://twitter.com/gautamrege) sir who make it work.
Finally, started with my presentation on ["Vagrant Plugin Development Intro"](http://www.slideshare.net/randomaccessman/vagrant-plugin-development-intro) and found my nervousness gone after initial 2-3 slides
:blush:. Looking audience at one glance through the stage was amazingly different,
pleasant with bit of nervousness feeling. I breathed a sign of relief :relieved: after I
done with my presentation.

In the evening, we had pool party which is the perfect place to talk, discuss, selfie/photo sessions,
dinner etc.

I remember we had more than an hour discussion session with **Matz** on topic ranging
from technology, language and its competitors, patterns, personal life, country, culture etc.
It was one of my memorable moment :innocent:.

Meanwhile, people were shouting and cheering from hotel inside for India in
[World T20 Match](http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty202016/engine/match/951341.html)
against Pakistan.
I went to sleep with peacefully after knowing that India won the match :smile:.

2nd day, I woke up and visited surroundings of hotel. It was nice and pleasant walk.

After having quick breakfast, I rushed to conference hall. The 2nd day ended by awesome
talk by [Charles](https://twitter.com/headius 'JRuby Dsigner').

Finally, I returned back to Bangalore in the morning of 21st March with a feeling of happiness
and excitement.
