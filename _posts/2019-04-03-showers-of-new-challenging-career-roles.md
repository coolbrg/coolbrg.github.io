Should I feel this way now?

> _"God does not merely give. He showers you."_

__Well Probably!__.

Let's analyze my career situation at this moment.

## Consultant to Accidental Director

Post leaving my glorious _Red Hat Days_, my previous employer, on Dec 5th, 2018, I quickly adapted my
mind for my friend's company with _Vague Desgination & Role._

__Vague!__

Ya, it was. Because, even working for first twenty days, I wasn't sure what _Designation_ I should 
say to my friends.

2019 first night passed and I have to say to my mind that I should be the 
_Chief Technical Officer (CTO)_ of [Averon Media](https://averonmedia.com){:target="_blank"}.
Although, I wanted to kept myself to the _Consultant_ role but quickly realized there was no one
more technically sound than me. 

__Huh!__

As I started to go to the small office of this _Yet Another Startup_, I experienced
many challenging situations and then realized that __*Running a startup is not everybody's cup of Tea.*__

Then, the day come when my friend told me, "_I have to become Director_ as one of the two is leaving to manage his own personal projects".

__Bang!__

Yes, it was kind of shocking but had to make up my mind.

## GbrG Academy Founder

           img="/company/gbrg.png"
           url="https://gbrgacademy.com"
           title="GbrG Academy"
           class="centered"
%}

I always feel that I had that spark within for _Teaching or Mentoring_. And, I even tested that spark by teaching few occasions whenever I got chance throughout the life I had so far.

Alongside to Averon Media, I was working on _GbrG Academy_ with tortoise's pace and got its website _First Cut_ up on
Feb 14, 2019. 

__*This gave me another reason to celebrate this date.*__

           url="https://gbrgacademy.com"
           title="GbrG Academy Website First Commit"
           class="centered"
%}

And, around twenty five days later on March 11, I wrote it's 
[inception story](https://gbrgacademy.com/blogs/inception-of-gbrg-academy){:target="_blank"}.

## Emerging Technology Trust (ETT) Member

{% include image.html
           img="/company/ett.png"
           url="https://ettindia.com"
           title="ETT India"
           class="centered"
%}

It was around seven plus years now since I have been involved in 
[FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software){:target="_blank"} and its community
activities like conference or meetup being as part of _attendee, voluteer, or organizer_.

__*"Community has given me a lot and I think it was time to contribute back at larger level."*__

On involing __seriously__ with ETT, I realized the need of _Single point of Entry_ for all the 
Events (conference or workshop) organized by it. And then,

__It clicked!__

__*I have to build the website for ETT India*__.

After taking reference of other conference websites, I got its _First Cut_ on Oct 27, 2018.

           img="/blog/ett-first-cut.png"
           title="ETT India Website First Commit"
           class="centered"
%}

And, wrote _Welcome Blog_ after ten days.

{% include image.html
           img="/blog/welcome-to-ett.png"
           url="https://ettindia.org"
           title="Welcome to ETT India"
           class="centered"

As in the words of legendary Martial Artist, [Bruce Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee){:target="_blank"},

> Do not pray for an easy life, pray for the strength to endure a difficult one.

I am expecting that God will give me strength as well to experience these challenges gracefully but
_I believe in myself more_ as most of the expectation didn't go in favor of me so far.
