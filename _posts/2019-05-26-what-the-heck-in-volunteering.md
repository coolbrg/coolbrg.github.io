In this Era, where we are surrounded by business-minded people, majorly, nothing is _Free_.

> Even, Volunteering is Not Free in this Era.

Referring to the definition of [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering),

{% include blogs/quote.html
           quote="Volunteering is generally considered an altruistic activity where an individual or group provides services for no financial or social gain \"to benefit another person, group or organization\"."
           quote_by="Wikipedia"
%}

An _altruistic activity_ means __Disinterested & Selfless concern for well-being of others__.

Having came across with above meaning, I thought,

{% include blogs/quote.html
           quote="Can we even behave altruistically in this Era?"
           quote_with_bar=true
%}

> I can not. I accept it. I have a selfish purpose of Volunteering.

TL;DR: And, I am _purposefully_ sharing my journey, of Volunteering with you.

## Introduction

It was back in 2012 when I attended my first technical conference, RubyConf India, in March 24-25.
And, who knows that, I would be the part of the same Organizing Team; some day.

           caption="RubyConf India 2012 Schedule"
%}

It all started by _that one person_ who always motivates you among the crowd on the particular thing he gained experience with.
In my case, it was _Pradeepto(PB)_ who triggered the spark of _FOSS_ and encouraged me to get involved in its
_Community Events_.

Being the first-timer, you go along with many emotions,

> Noob, Loneliness, Being Unknown, Nervousness, Feeling Inferiority Complexity, Confident enough to stand etc etc.

I was lucky. I went along with my colleagues.

The event was wonderful; obviously I didn't had the comparison stats. I got the chance to met [Charles Nutter, JRuby Creator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JRuby){:target="_blank"}. I would say, it was the first _fan moment_ in the context of _Tech Celebs_.
Also, I got the glimpse of [Matz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto){:target="_blank"} through
`Video Keynote`. I am amazed by the volume of cheering happened and quickly sensed that he was definitely some key
person and later found it was _the creator of [Ruby Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)){:target="_blank"}_.

## First Known Volunteering

Till 2016, I had been involved in many community events like _attending meetups or conferences_ and volunteered partially in
_RubyConf_. But, honestly speaking, my sense of being _Responsible Volunteer_ reached to pro-level post joining
_[Red Hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat)_ on Feb, 2016. On the same year, I volunteered for two conferences,
[GopherCon India 2016]({% post_url 2016-02-27-gopherconf-india-2016-volunteer-experience %}){:target="_blank"} and
[RubyConfIndia 2016]({% post_url 2016-04-24-rubyconf-experience %}){:target="_blank"}. Interestingly, both the conference
tickets were sponsored by my company.

{% include blogs/quote.html
           quote="How coool the company was!!!"
           quote_with_bar=true
%}

I mostly landed in doing Company's Brand promotion and getting familiar with many amazing people from the tech community.

The best part of the volunteering was

{% include blogs/quote.html
           quote="1. Having early access to Speakers<br>2. Known face in the Event<br>3. Free ticket (sometimes)<br>
           4. Lot of Learning in both technical & non-technical<br>5. Access to Party<br>
           6. Get familiar with many like-minded people<br>
           7. etc ..."
%}

Apart from above, I had the chance to take selfies with few prominent speakers and [Matz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto){:target="_blank"} himself.

## Default Volunteer

My frequency of volunteering had reached to a level where I was known as the __*Default Volunteer*__ among few of the
Organizers of the events organized under [Emerging Technology Trust (ETT), India](https://ettindia.org).

I would like to give special thanks to [Satish Sir](https://twitter.com/indianguru) for always giving me chance of volunteering whenever I asked for. I am just speechless when I see his dedication over community events even at the age of 60+.

Out of the following tasks in volunteering,

{% include blogs/quote.html
           quote="1. Registration Desk<br>2. Following Up Speakers<br>3. Segregation & Distribution of Swags<br>
           4. Handling Audio/Video<br>5. Handling Mic during Q&A post each talk<br>
           6. etc ..."
%}

the _Registration Desk_ was the best experience. During its peak hour, one can experience the real essence of it.
It usually fall half an hour or an hour later then the mentioned time of registration here in India where people start
rushing for registration in bulk.

           caption="Registration Desk at RubyConf India 2016"
%}

After many years of _Successful Volunteering_, it was time to promote to _Organizer_ level. I got this sense when one of
the organizer told me

> How long will you do this? Level Up, Buddy!

{% include blogs/break.html %}

## First Organizer Experience

It was during [DevOpsDay India 2018](https://devopsdaysindia.org/2018/index.html){:target="_blank"}, when I had the taste of
my first organizer's experience.

The tasks associated with _Organizer_ is completely different than the _Volunteer_. It mainly includes

{% include blogs/quote.html
           quote="1. Getting the Sponsors<br>2. Deal with Official Agreements<br>3. Marketing of the Event<br>
           4. Finalizing the Event Venue<br>5. Catering<br>6. Maintaining Event Website<br>
           7. Call for Speakers & Filter best ones<br> 8. Call for Volunteers & Manage them<br>
           9. Handling Ticketing<br>10. etc ..."
%}

I started with handling the website and came up with [ETT Website](https://ettindia.org){:target="_blank"} as I felt there
should be a central place of all the events organized by it. ETT was organizing seven plus conferences & events and at
least I was not aware of it.

During the event, this time, my emotions of responsibility was completely different than the emotions of responsibility I
had as a volunteer.

> Now, I was managing the pool of Volunteers.

           quote="How coool is that!!!"
           quote_with_bar=true
%}

Post this, I helped organizing the _GopherCon India 2019_ and _RubyConf India 2019_.

One of the few special moments I had during this was to spent time with both
[Matz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto){:target="_blank"} and
[Charles Nutter](https://twitter.com/headius){:target="_blank"}. Both were very friendly and understanding.
We really had nice intense technical conversation around Ruby and its further growth.

## What I learnt out of my Selfish Volunteering

Definitely there was some learning each time during my volunteering apart from having fun.

Following are few incidents which I felt happpend,

{% include blogs/quote.html
           quote="1. Communication Improved<br>2. Management Skills Improved<br>3. Self-Branding Increased<br>
           4. Scaled Up Technical Knowledge<br>5. Got More Friends<br>
           6. Had Fun<br>
           7. Overall Personality Improved<br>
           8. etc ..."
%}

Just thinking sometime,

## What am I volunteering now?

Presently, I have involved myself in [Nepal's Biggest Hackathon](https://everest-hack.com){:target="_blank"} apart from
partially active in [ETT](https://ettindia.org){:target="_blank"} events.

Now, I am really realizing the value of _those four magical words_ to an Organizer.
