The 2<sup>nd</sup> edition of [**Gophercon India**](http://www.gophercon.in 'Awesome Conf') was held in the Taj Vivanta, Bangalore on 19-20<sup>th</sup> of Feb, 2016.
This time we had a record ~350 people who attended the event on both days.
I had the wonderful privilege to be part of it as **Volunteer**. Following is the summary of my amazing experience I had during this event.

It all started with a simple _hangout chat_ with [Satish Sir](http://satishtalim.com 'Mentor') a month ago the
event when I asked him about volunteering. He agreed and instructed me to come at 7:15 AM at Taj on 19th
Feb.

Between this period I was going through my job transition and joined [Red Hat India](http://redhat.com)
on 8th Feb(Monday).<!-- and had gone through amazing experience of relocation process. -->
I managed to get two colleagues([Mohammad Zeeshan](https://twitter.com/zee_10000) and [Suraj Deshmukh](https://twitter.com/surajd_)) as volunteer two days before the event.

Finally, the event day arrived. I reached on time at ~7:30 AM at Taj Vivanta by **Ola Auto**.
After getting instructions from [**Gautam**]( 'Organizer'), we started to put the stuff like Digital Ocean
credit sticker, writing pad, bottle etc into beautiful conference bag. Meanwhile, others were busy in unpacking the
T-shirts. Along with conference T-shirt, there were others T-shirts that were sponsored by companies like Go-Jek, Minio, Exotel etc.

One of the main responsibility of Volunteers was **Handling the Reception Desk**. The task here was to
make sure every _speaker/organizer/volunteer/attendee_ got registered and given **Conference Bag**. This process
help us to get the total count of people who could make it to the conference.

After most of the registration process was over, I moved into conference room where I took the responsibility of **handling mic** which was being used during the *Q and A* session after each talk.

I enjoyed each and every moment of **Volunteering** during this event. I had chat with many folks here and also clicked selfies with few speakers whose talk I found interesting.

Finally, on last day i.e on 20th Feb, dinner for _speakers/volunteers/organizers_ was arranged by [Minio](https://www.minio.io 'Platinum And Technology Sponsor') where we had healthy chat over languages, technology, hobby, likes, dislikes etc.
