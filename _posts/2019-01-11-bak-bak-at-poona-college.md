_Do you want to bring all your college memories?_

It's simple.

_Go pay a visit to your college and you will achieve above thing._

Recently, I paid a visit to my college, [_Poona College of Arts, Science and Commerce_](http://www.akipoonacollege.ac.in/),
after having much to & fro discussion with _Quddus Sir_, an energetic and passionate professor,
and delievered my **first ever**

> [Bak-Bak](https://en.bab.la/dictionary/hindi-english/%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%95-%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE){:target="_blank"} + Q&A.

*Note*: **Bak-Bak** is an Hindi colloquial word which means *to give lecture* mostly derived by students
of this generation or *to talk* as formal meaning.

## What I had planned

Obviously, when you are invited, kind of, for some presentation in college, you do some planning.

I had these plans too
- make presentation
- practice "public speaking" in front of the mirror
- get nice presentation dress like "Tuxedo" or "Blazer"
- ...

And,

***I made mistake(s)***

&

*above plans had to go through the same fate like previous plans in my life, i.e written into some dark corner of my brain-disk*.

### Pre-Bak-Bak

We all were in a room where we used to do practicals, write/copy/paste programs and send it to a machine called
_printer_ whose job was to simply print lines in smooth or zigzag fashion. This machine became so important in
itself that even though our practical programs were complete in our labs machine, we won't get marks without
getting our paper filled with full of it's black marks showing some mercy to header and footer.

I was able to _almost completely recall my old memories_ of this particular room specially by the fact that the
layout, the white board, the projector sheet, rack for bagpack, similarly looking machines with same old OS i.e
_Fedora_ with changed version, and few others were almost same as it was _way back in my college days_.

I quickly got ready with my setup by plugging my lappi's charger and connecting VGA port of the projecter. I had to
_struggle a bit with Internet_ as my own dongle or mobile hotspot was not working. Thanks to the girl who shared
her hotspot which had different service provider.

As usual, I was introduced by our Head of Department(HOD), _Mehtab Alam sir_, in his own classic style and somehow
made me as fan of this style, like it had made others in surrounding. He was accompained by my first programming language (`C`) teacher, _Shaheda Madam_, ready with paper-of-intro.

Meanwhile, students were listning to this _introduction_ with full attention, as I could see their eyes were open.
After all, it's their HOD who is speaking infront of them. Hence, they had to listen or at least keep their eyes
open.

I was not surprised as I used to do the same _way back in my college days_ but in my own style.

## During-Bak-Bak

Post my intro, I quickly started and said, *"Hi, Guys"*. Meanwhile, I was saying to myself,
"Students are going to screwed today as they had to listen my _Bak-Bak_".

I was able to see lot of faces through 180 degree glance;<br>
> happy, confident, over-confident, timid, confused, suprised, talkative, kiddy-arrogance, shy, calm, enthusiast,
mischievous, hard-working, intelligent, smart, beautiful, ....

I began with the topics I was going to discuss and also shared my views on it.

Meanwhile, told them to write the points they should keep in mind or things to take from this _Bak-Bak_.

### Topics I discussed

- [Free & Open Source Software (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software){:target="_blank"}
- Community
- Industry Trends

#### FOSS

I started with asking question on _Open Source_ and as I was expecting, student gave me the partial answer
which they might have heard, read or listened somewhere. I could understand it's hard to know things happening
outside of college academic bounderies.

One can find the good info about FOSS on [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software){:target="_blank"}.

In my opinion(IMO), it's meaning is different to different people and there is no _exact_ correct definition.

I would recommend someone to read, analyze, experience it and then devise your own definition.

#### Community

Definition of community was in similar state as of FOSS in context of students.

I simply told to remember at least these words in FOSS context,

> Community is a group of people who comes together, share their own experience on some common interests or technology in particularly."

Rest, I would like them to experience it and gave pointers to start.

#### Industry Trends

I simply told them, next trend is _Open Source_.

[Red Hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat){:target="_blank"} has done(proved) it and others are following it.

## Post-Bak-Bak

Finally, it was time to summarize the whole _Bak-Bak_.

And, we came into following _bullet-phrases_ on which they need to work on

{% include blogs/quote.html 
           quote="1. Keep Good Attitude<br>2. Have Right Approach<br>3. Be Open<br>
           4. Have Good Communication Skills<br>5. Keep yourself Upto Date<br>6. Motivate Yourself<br>
           7. Make Mistakes but try avoid to repeat"
           quote_with_bar=true
%}

## Disclaimer

During the _Bak-Bak_, I found students were laughing. Not sure why?

Finally, said _Goodbye_ with disclaimer message as

> I am not a standup comedian or motivational speaker.
